## Extracting

The isos bigger than certain threshold are provided in multipart zip files because of the filesize restriction of github. To extract the iso, download all the zipped parts, and open the zip file with ``file-roller``, ``engrampa`` or ``7z``.

or run

```
cat manjaro-deepin-23.0.3-231005-linux61.iso.z** > manjaro-deepin.zip
unzip manjaro-deepin.zip

```

This should automatically extract the iso from all the files.

Main content of this update:
* Update Manjaro system to the latest
* Fixed problem where the file manager required manual refreshing to display content.

## Update frequency changed
Unfortunately, my external hard drive is damaged and cannot be repaired. Due to limited space on my computer, I can only reduce the update frequency and may not synchronize the ISO image after a big update. A new image will not be released until the official release of Deepin23. The interval between releasing new images will be at least 3 months. However, if there are no big updates after 3 months of a image release (excluding updates during this period), a new image will not be created. The new image will be released after a big update.
